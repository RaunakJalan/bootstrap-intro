COURSERA - Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4

This course is perfect for those who know HTML, CSS but are unable to put it in application. This course focuses on how to write good and non-messy code using Bootstrap.

This repository does not contain single files for each topic but instead a project was modified from a simple HTML file webpage to the latest result. All the exercises in this course are done in this project.  

All the related code can be found here. There are some bootstrap classes that were deleted in latest commit. So, one can always go back to look for the content they need in older commits. All the commits are labeled with what was modified in them.


Happy Coding!!
